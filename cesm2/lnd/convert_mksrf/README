Process to follow:

1.) Unzip the glacier topo file you will need (or get your own data)

For example:

 gunzip ../../../cesm1/lnd/convert_mksrf/topo/topo-ice.05.lgm21ka.example.nc.gz

2.) Set environment variable DIN_LOC_ROOT to location of CESM2 inputdata

setenv DIN_LOC_ROOT /glade/p/cesm/cseg/inputdata

This path will be used in the NCL scripts

2.) Regrid glacier and PFT data to a half degree grid

IMPORTANT NOTE: HAS TO BE DONE ON A LARGE MEMORY MACHINE!

This step also takes several hours of compute time.

 sbatch runregrid.csh

or

 ncl regrid_GLCMEC_n_PFT.ncl

3.) Run convert_mksrf to convert Glacier, Land-water, and PFT datasets

  See README.convert_mksrf

4.) Edit nn_fill.ncl to point to your files

5.) Run nn_fill.ncl to create new datasets needed by CESM2/components/lnd/tools/mksurfdata_map


 ncl nn_fill.ncl

6.) Run mksurfdata_map with the datasets you created and the mapping files that go with them


use the example namelist: (example namelist works with CTSM release-clm5.0.16)

surfdata_0.9x1.25_hist_16pfts_nourb_CMIP6_simyr21ka_example.namelist
